When i > 0 and j > 0, if matrix[i][j] = '0', then dp[i][j] = 0 since no square will be able to contain the '0' at that cell. If matrix[i][j] = '1', we will have dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1, which means that the square will be limited by its left, upper and upper-left neighbors.
